Question #28
        Invert Binary Tree
        Difficulty :Medium Category :Tree
        Write a method that takes in a Binary Tree and inverts it. In other words, the function should swap
        every left node in the tree for its corresponding right node. Each BinaryTree node has an integer
        value , a left child node, and a right child node. Children nodes can either be BinaryTree nodes
        themselves or None / null .
        Sample input:
                 1
               /   \
              2     3
             / \    / \
            4   5   6   7
           /     \
          8       9

          Sample Output:
                 1
               /   \
              3     2
             / \    / \
            6   7   5   4
                   /     \
                  9       8
